This is a [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) implementation for PHP based on Stefan Goessner's JSONPath script.

JSONPath is an XPath-like expression language for filtering, flattening and extracting data.

This project aims to be a clean and simple implementation with the following goals:

 - Object-oriented code (should be easier to manage or extend in future)
 - Expressions are parsed into tokens using code inspired by the Doctrine Lexer. The tokens are cached internally to avoid re-parsing the expressions.
 - There is no `eval()` in use
 - Any combination of objects/arrays/ArrayAccess-objects can be used as the data input which is great if you're de-serializing JSON in to objects or if you want to process your own data structures.

Installation
---

**PHP 7.1+**
```bash
composer require softcreatr/jsonpath
```
**PHP < 7.1**

Support for PHP < 7.1 has been dropped. However, legacy branches exist for PHP 5.6 and 7.0 and can be composer-installed as follows:

* PHP 7.0: `"softcreatr/jsonpath": "dev-php-70"`
* PHP 5.6: `"softcreatr/jsonpath": "dev-php-56"`

ðŸ”» Please note, that these legacy branches (based on JSONPath 0.6.2) are protected. There are no intentions to make any updates here. Please consider upgrading to PHP 7.2 or newer.

JSONPath Examples
---

JSONPath                  | Result
--------------------------|-------------------------------------
`$.store.books[*].author` | the authors of all books in the store
`$..author`               | all authors
`$.store..price`          | the price of everything in the store.
`$..books[2]`             | the third book
`$..books[(@.length-1)]`  | the last book in order.
`$..books[-1:]`           | the last book in order.
`$..books[0,1]`           | the first two books
`$..books[:2]`            | the first two books
`$..books[::2]`           | every second book starting from first one
`$..books[1:6:3]`         | every third book starting from 1 till 6
`$..books[?(@.isbn)]`     | filter all books with isbn number
`$..books[?(@.price<10)]` | filter all books cheaper than 10
`$..*`                    | all elements in the data (recursively extracted)


Expression syntax
---

Symbol                | Description
----------------------|-------------------------
`$`                   | The root object/element (not strictly necessary)
`@`                   | The current object/element
`.` or `[]`           | Child operator
`..`                  | Recursive descent
`*`                   | Wildcard. All child elements regardless their index.
`[,]`                 | Array indices as a set
`[start:end:step]`    | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4/Python.
`?()`                 | Filters a result set by a script expression
`()`                  | Uses the result of a script expression as the index

PHP Usage
---

```php
$data = ['people' => [['name' => 'Joe'], ['name' => 'Jane'], ['name' => 'John']]];
$result = (new JSONPath($data))->find('$.people.*.name'); // returns new JSONPath
// $result[0] === 'Joe'
// $result[1] === 'Jane'
// $result[2] === 'John'
```

### Magic method access

The options flag `JSONPath::ALLOW_MAGIC` will instruct JSONPath when retrieving a value to first check if an object
has a magic `__get()` method and will call this method if available. This feature is *iffy* and
not very predictable as:

-  wildcard and recursive features will only look at public properties and can't smell which properties are magically accessible
-  there is no `property_exists` check for magic methods so an object with a magic `__get()` will always return `true` when checking
   if the property exists
-   any errors thrown or unpredictable behaviour caused by fetching via `__get()` is your own problem to deal with

```php
$jsonPath = new JSONPath($myObject, JSONPath::ALLOW_MAGIC);
```

For more examples, check the JSONPathTest.php tests file.

Script expressions
-------

Script expressions are not supported as the original author intended because:

-   This would only be achievable through `eval` (boo).
-   Using the script engine from different languages defeats the purpose of having a single expression evaluate the same way in different
    languages which seems like a bit of a flaw if you're creating an abstract expression syntax.

So here are the types of query expressions that are supported:

	[?(@._KEY_ _OPERATOR_ _VALUE_)] // <, >, <=, >=, !=, ==, =~, in and nin
	e.g.
	[?(@.title == "A string")] //
	[?(@.title = "A string")]
	// A single equals is not an assignment but the SQL-style of '=='
	[?(@.title =~ /^a(nother)? string$/i)]
	[?(@.title in ["A string", "Another string"])]
	[?(@.title nin ["A string", "Another string"])]
	
Known issues
------

- This project has not implemented multiple string indexes e.g. `$[name,year]` or `$["name","year"]`. I have no ETA on that feature, and it would require some re-writing of the parser that uses a very basic regex implementation.
